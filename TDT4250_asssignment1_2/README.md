# TDT4250_assignment1
The repository contains all the files and foldes that are generated when starting a new Ecore Modeling Project in Eclipse. The "model"-folder contains the files from the EMF model, while the "src-gen"-folder has the code generated from the .genmodel file. Manually written and generated constraints can be found in /src-gen/tDT4250_assignment1_2.util/tDT4250_assignment1_2Validator.java.
